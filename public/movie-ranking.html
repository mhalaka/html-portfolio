    (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his new partner (Mark Ruffalo) to Ashecliffe Hospital,

    he will have to confront his own dark fears if he hopes to make it off the island alive.</p>

<h3>Spider-Man: No Way Home - 2021</h3>

    means to be Spider-Man.</p>

<h3>Joker - 2019</h3>
<p>Forever alone in a crowd, failed comedian Arthur Fleck seeks connection as he walks
    the streets of Gotham City. Arthur wears two masks -- the one he paints for his day

    of the world around him. Isolated, bullied and disregarded by society, Fleck begins
    a slow descent into madness as he transforms into the criminal mastermind known as the Joker.</p>
